### Course Description:

This module introduces ideas that are fundamental to building a conceptual understanding of computation for creative practice. Computational thinking requires more than writing code. It requires learning new ways to think about problem solving. Only by breaking complex problems down into their smallest steps and ordering those steps, is it possible to write functional programs. This module will introduce Computational Thinking, Integrated Development Environments, Binary Numbers, Hexadecimal numbers, Functional programming, Object Oriented Programming, fundamental logical structures and data structures used in programming, stacks, L-systems and recursion. In addition, students will learn how to create, read and write to files. 

To gain mastery of these concepts, students will work through a series of computational problems using accessible programming languages, such as Python. This unit is delivered through a set of mini games and problems which students will need to solve. Completing each challenge, students will need to show they have understood the new concept as well as built on any former material. By the end of the module, students will be able to write simple programs and demonstrate the ability to deconstruct verbal problems in order to write simple software.
